### Data-Mining-Algorithms
This repository hosts major data mining algorithms used in the industry. For comprehensive understanding each algorithm is developed from scratch.

The algorithms discussed here are  :
- Clustering
    - Agglomerative Clustering
    - DBScan
    - K Means 
- ML Estimation
    - Apriori Estimation
    - Expectation Maximization 
    - Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)
- Classification
    - Decision Tree
    - Naive Bayes
- Shortest Path 
    - Dijkstra Algorithm (graph)
    - Dynamic Programming
- Linear Algebra Functions 
    - Eigen Value and covariance calculation    
    - Singular Value Decomposition

This is a repo in development and new algorithms will be added as time permits.
